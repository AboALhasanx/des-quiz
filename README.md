# DES Quiz

A simple static quiz project consisting of multiple choice quizzes organized into separate HTML pages. Currently, the repository includes placeholder pages without actual questions or interactivity.

## Project Overview

- **index.html**: Landing page that links to each quiz level
- **preliminary.html**: Placeholder page for the preliminary (تمهيدي) quiz
- **national.html**: Placeholder page for the national (وطني) quiz
- **postgraduate.html**: Placeholder page for the postgraduate (دراسات عليا) quiz

Each quiz page currently displays a title and a thank-you message, but lacks any actual question content or form elements.

## Features

- Pure HTML implementation (no CSS, JavaScript, or external libraries)
- Easy to navigate between quiz levels

## Getting Started

To run the quizzes locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AboALhasanx/des-quiz.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click on any quiz link to view the corresponding page.

## Next Steps / Suggestions

- **Add actual quiz questions**: Populate each quiz page with multiple-choice questions and answer inputs.
- **Use JSON data**: Store questions and answers in JSON files and load them dynamically via JavaScript.
- **Styling**: Add CSS styles (external or inline) for better layout and readability.
- **Interactivity**: Implement JavaScript logic to validate answers, calculate score, and display results.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure forms are accessible, with proper labels and focus states.
